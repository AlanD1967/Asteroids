          ASTEROIDS INTERNALS           -------------------------------------------------

This document contains the memory layout and locations for Asteroids:

First the ROM load locations, the ROM's listed here are version 2, but
version 1 ROM's load at the same place and are the same length.  In fact,
your emulator will be able to run either version with no changes.  The only
difference, from your emulator's point of view, is the location of the game's
high-score table (for saving/loading from disk).

All addresses in this document refer to the 'virtual 6502' memory space and
are given in HEX unless stated:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ROM LOAD LOCATIONS:
-------------------

  035127.02 --- State Machine ROM, 1000h bytes, ORG 5000h

  035145.02 --- Game ROM, 0800h bytes, ORG 6800h
  035144.02 --- Game ROM, 0800h bytes, ORG 7000h
  035143.02 --- Game ROM, 0800h bytes, ORG 7800h

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASTEROIDS MEMORY LOCATIONS AND PURPOSE:
---------------------------------------

  2002h --- VECTOR HALT This address is used in the real Asteroids machine as
                        a flag from the State Machine to signal that it's
                        finished.  However; in emulation, it's easier to run
                        your 'virtual State Machine' flat out when the 6502
                        requests the next frame.  You should ZERO this
                        location before running the 6502 code, then just
                        ignore it.

  2003h --- HYPERSPACE  SET BIT 7 to HYPERSPACE (hyperspace button)

  2004h --- FIRE        SET BIT 7 to FIRE (fire button)

  2007h --- SELF TEST   This address has something to do with the slam and or
                        'Self Test' mode.  Just ZERO it before running the
                        6502 code, then ignore it.

  2400h --- COIN IN	SET BIT 7 to deposit a coin


  2403h --- START 1P    SET BIT 7 for a one player game (player 1 button)

  2404h --- START 2P    SET BIT 7 for a two player game (player 2 button)

  2405h --- THRUST      SET BIT 7 to THRUST (thrust button)

  2406h --- ROTATE R    SET BIT 7 to ROTATE RIGHT (rotate right button)

  2407h --- ROTATE L    SET BIT 7 to ROTATE LEFT (rotate left button)


  2800h --- DIPSW 8-7   The lower two bits of this address hold dip-switches
                        8 and 7.

  2801h --- DIPSW 6-5   The lower two bits of this address hold dip-switches
                        6 and 5.

  2802h --- DIPSW 4-3   The lower two bits of this address hold dip-switches
                        4 and 3.

  2803h --- DIPSW 2-1   The lower two bits of this address hold dip-switches
                        2 and 1.

  3000h --- VECTOR GO.  When Asteroids writes to this address run your VECTOR
                        State Machine, which will then draw the next frame.
                        The value written is not important, it's the 'write'
                        that counts.

  3200h --- BANK SWAP.  BIT 2 of this address is toggled to swap banks.  This
                        is for the two player game.  Monitor this address and
                        when Asteroids toggles BIT 2 just swap 100h bytes
                        from address 200h to address 300h and vice-versa.
                        The state of the BIT is not important, when it changes
                        just perform the swap.

  3600h --- EXPLOSION   The EXPLOSION circuit sound register.  The following
                        values trigger the required explosion sound:

                        03Dh --- Trigger LARGE explosion
                        0FDh --- Trigger MEDIUM explosion
                        0BDh --- Trigger SMALL explosion

                        You may have to adjust these values up or down a
                        couple to ensure the explosion happens every time and
                        the explosion sound occurs when you die on re-entry
                        from hyperspace.

  3A00h --- HEARTBEAT   The HEARTBEAT circuit sound register.  Monitor BIT 4
                        of this address, when it's SET check BIT 2, if BIT 2
                        is SET play BEAT 2 else play BEAT 1.

  3C00h --- SAUCER ON   Monitor BIT 7 of this address, when it's SET it means
                        there is a SAUCER on screen so check 3C02h to find
                        out which size of saucer and therefore which sound.
                        Then just LOOP the sound until BIT 7 of this address
                        becomes CLEAR.

  3C01h --- UFO FIRE    Monitor this address, as soon as it becomes NON-ZERO
                        start playing the UFO (SAUCER) FIRE sound.

  3C02h --- SAUCER ON 2 When BIT 7 of 3C00h is SET check BIT 7 here, if it's
                        SET start playing the LARGE SAUCER sound, else start
                        playing the SMALL SAUCER sound.

  3C03h --- THRUST      Monitor this address, when BIT 7 is SET loop the
                        THRUST sound.

  3C04h --- PLAYER FIRE Monitor this address, as soon as it becomes NON-ZERO
                        start playing the PLAYER FIRE sound.

  3C05h --- EXTRA LIFE  Whilst this address holds a NON-ZERO value just LOOP
                        the EXTRA LIFE sound.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HIGH-SCORE table is stored at the following addresses and is 53 bytes:

  Version ONE rom:  0028h
  Version TWO rom:  0029h

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asteroids doesn't use the IRQ's of the 6502 but DOES use the NMI.  It is very
important to activate a 'virtual NMI' on your 6502 emulator approximately
every 6250 cycles of the 6502.

End.
