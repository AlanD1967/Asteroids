          ASTEROIDS INTERNALS           -------------------------------------------------

The sound samples are 11025hz, 8-Bit Unsigned Mono.

The samples are stored in SOUNDS.ZIP and are as follows:


BEAT1    WAV           865  One of the 'Thump Thump' heartbeats
BEAT2    WAV           902  The other 'Thump Thump' heartbeat

EXTRAMAN WAV         1,472  'Extra Life' beep

LSAUCER  WAV         1,901  'Large Saucer' on screen sound
SSAUCER  WAV         1,413  'Small Saucer' on screen sound

LARGEXPL WAV         9,562  'Large Rock' explosion
MEDUMXPL WAV        10,894  'Medium Rock' explosion
SMALLXPL WAV         9,601  'Small Rock' explosion

YOURFIRE WAV         2,761  'Player Laser'
UFOFIRE  WAV         2,555  'Saucer Laser'

THRUST   WAV         1,005  'Player Thrust'


Several of these samples 'loop'.  Just read the Asteroids memory location
(check MEMORY.DOC) and when it signals the sound just keep playing the
sample until the memory location is cleared by the Asteroids code.  The
samples that 'loop' are:

  The 'Extra Life' beep
  Both 'Saucer' sounds
  The 'Player Thrust' sound

All the other samples are 'play until done'.  These can be interrupted and
restarted by the Asteroids program.  For example, only one explosion can
occur at any one time, but explosions can interrupt each other.  When an
explosion is interrupted by another the original explosion is not continued
after the 'new' explosion finishes.  Theoretically all samples can play at
once as Asteroids used separate circuits for each sound, thus:

  Explosion Circuit
  Saucer Circuit
  Your Fire Circuit
  UFO Fire Circuit
  Thrust Circuit
  Heartbeat Circuit
  Extra Life Circuit

As you can see, a possible seven sounds at once.  But notice that there can
only be one explosion, one saucer and one heartbeat at any one time because
these sounds, like the three explosions for example, share a common circuit
each.

Check MEMORY.DOC to see what memory locations and what values trigger each
sound.


End.
